# A3D-HRC-Maya-Script
This is a .py that exports the relevant information from the maya scene to a JSON file.

# What you will need:

Autodesk Maya 2022 is required to run the script.

# How to use:

Create a maya scene and load your animation IT IS IMPORTANT TO DELETE ALL THE MESHES IF THERE ARE ANY.

In the main menu bar, select Windows > Settings/Preferences > Plug-in Manager and click "Browse" then search for the .py.

The export process may take some time depending on how long the animation is.

ThisisHH and some friends for helping me and giving me some ideas.

# Notes:

This script only works with a node hierarchy, if your animation has an armature I highly recommend opening your animation on noesis and exporting it as a .FBX, then re-open it again on Maya.

If you find any issue, please contact me on my discord (gilda.) Any feedback is appreciated!
